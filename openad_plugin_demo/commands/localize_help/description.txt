This command demonstrates the easiest way to localize your command desciption in different languages by providing multiple description files for the different languages and regions.

You should not include the encoding, but you can optionally include the region, eg. British or American English, French or Belgian French.

<yellow>Note 1:</yellow> Always provide the default description in English.

<yellow>Note 2:</yellow> When providing localization for a specific region, make sure to always provide a fallback localization for the same language without region. For example:
- <green>âˆš</green> <cmd>fr_BE</cmd> + <cmd>fr</cmd> = Belgian French + any French --> <green>GOOD</green>
- <red>x</red> <cmd>fr_BE</cmd> + <cmd>fr_FR</cmd> = Belgian French + French French --> <red>BAD</red> now Canadian French <cmd>fr_CA</cmd> will be served English.

In this example we provide:
- <yellow>description.txt</yellow> (English, default)
- <yellow>description--fr.txt</yellow> (French, any region)
- <yellow>description--fr_BE.txt</yellow> (French, Belgium)

To test it out, exit the OpenAD shell, set your language and re-run the command help.
